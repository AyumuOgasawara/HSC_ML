### Classifying HSC sources using machine learing without spectra
These scripts explore galaxy/quasar/star classification from photometry sources from the HSC (Hyper Suprime-Cam) using machine learning.

I used matched sources with spectroscopically labelled sources from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) to train an optimised random forest classifier.

And also I used a non-linear dimension reduction technique (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection: UMAP) in fully-supervised schemes to visualise the separation of galaxies, quasars, and stars in a two-dimensional space.
